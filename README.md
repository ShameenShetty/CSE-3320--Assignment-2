# CSE-3320--Assignment-2
Second assignment for CSE3320 (Operating Systems) where we gain hands-on experience with parallel programming and the difficulty of building correct parallel programs. According to the assignment, we are tasked with helping our professor schedule his office hours. The professor is teaching 2 classes this semester, class A and class B, and is holding shared office hours for both the classes in his office. The professor can have a large number of students showing up for his office hours, so he decides to impose several restrictions which are given in the assignment.
